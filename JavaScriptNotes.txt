ChatGPT  Code Explanation Link ()


1. Console.log("Hello World !");
    log is used to print a message. In this case, it will display "Hello World!" in the console of your web browser.

2. Variables:
    Variables are cointainers for data. 
    x= null;  
    null is a special value in JavaScript that means  "no value" or "nothing". It's like an empty box with no content inside of 

    y= undefined;
    Means a variable has been declared but not given a value yet.


    Block Scope: means { } whatever is written inside is call a block 
    
1.var:

Use var to declare a variable.
Variables declared with var can be accessed from anywhere in the function or program.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
var age = 25;
function greet() {
    var name = "John";
}
let:

Use let to declare a variable.
Variables declared with let can only be accessed within the block of code they are declared in.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let age = 25;
if (true) {
    let name = "John";
}
const:

Use const to declare a constant.
Constants cannot be changed once they are assigned a value.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const PI = 3.14;
In simple terms:

var is like a container that can be accessed from anywhere in the function or program.
let is like a container that can only be accessed within the block of code it's in.
const is for values that never change, like a fixed number.


BigInt:

BigInt is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than the largest number that can be represented with the Number primitive.
It allows you to work with arbitrarily large integers.
To create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer literal or call the BigInt() function.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
const anotherBigInt = BigInt("9007199254740992");
Symbol:

Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).
It is used to create unique identifiers for object properties, preventing naming collisions.
Symbols are immutable and unique. Even if you create two symbols with the same description, they are still different.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const symbol1 = Symbol("description");
const symbol2 = Symbol("description");
console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // Output: false
In simple terms:

BigInt is for representing very large integers beyond the limit of regular numbers.
Symbol is for creating unique identifiers, especially useful for object properties.

Object:

An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be any data type (including other objects).
Objects are used to represent complex data structures and are one of the fundamental data types in JavaScript.
They are created using curly braces {} or the new Object() constructor.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Using object literal notation
const Student = {
    name: "John",
    age: 20,
    cgpa : 8.2,
    isPass: true
};
// Using the Object constructor
const car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Corolla";
car.year = 2022;
Accessing Properties:

Properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object["property"]).
Dot notation is preferred when the property name is known and is a valid identifier.
Bracket notation is necessary when the property name contains special characters or is stored in a variable.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(car["make"]); // Output: Toyota

const propertyName = "age";
console.log(person[propertyName]); // Output: 30
Methods:

Properties of an object can also be functions, called methods.
Methods can perform actions or calculations using the object's data.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const person = {
    name: "John",
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
In simple terms:

Objects in JavaScript are like containers that hold related information.
They have properties (variables) and methods (functions).
Properties can be accessed using dot or bracket notation.

//if i want to change the age later of an object here is how to do it.
 student["age"] += 1; //or we can use dot notation like this: student.age += 1;
 console.log(student.age);
 // or you can do the same by console.log(student["age"]); 

 for...of Loop:

The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
It provides an easier and more readable way to iterate over the elements of an iterable compared to traditional for loops or forEach methods.
Example with an array:
javascript
Copy code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (const number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
for...in Loop:

The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.
It iterates over all enumerable properties, including inherited ones (from the object's prototype chain).
Example with an object:
javascript
Copy code
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    gender: "male"
};
for (const key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
// Output:
// name: John
// age: 30
// gender: male
In simple terms:

Use for...of loop to iterate over the elements of an iterable (like arrays).
Use for...in loop to iterate over the properties of an object.

for...of Loop:

Used to loop through elements of arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
It directly iterates over the values of the collection.
Best for iterating through values of iterable objects.
for...in Loop:

Used to loop through properties of objects.
It iterates over enumerable properties of an object, including inherited ones.
Best for looping through object properties.
In very simple terms:

for...of is for looping through values in collections like arrays.
for...in is for looping through properties in objects.
Remember, for...of loops over values, while for...in loops over properties. This distinction is important to choose the right loop for your task.

Template literals

 is basically used to print or  display any type of data in a more readable way for eg 
const pen = {
    product : "Pen",
    price : "$10"
};
rather than writting 
console.log("the ", pen.product, " costs $", pen.price); we can write :: 
let  output = `The ${pen.product} costs ${pen.price}`; 
this will give the result The Pen costs $10
console.log(output);

STRING INTERPOLATION:
String interpolation in template literals is a way to put variables or expressions inside a string. It allows you to combine text with variables or expressions in a more readable and convenient way.

Here's a simple explanation:

Using Variables:

You can insert variables directly into a string using ${} inside backticks (``).
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const name = "Alice";
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
// Output: Hello, Alice!
Using Expressions:

You can also include expressions inside ${}.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const a = 5;
const b = 3;
const result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`;
// Output: The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
In simple terms:

String interpolation in template literals allows you to easily include variables or expressions inside a string using ${}.
It makes your code more readable and concise compared to traditional string concatenation.


forEach--=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
ForEAch()
arr.forEach(callBackFunction)
callBaclFunction is afunction to execute for each element in the array, a callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
in forEach; arr.forEach((val,index,array)) are used as pararmeter 
arr.forEach ((val) => { console.log(val);})

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
// forEach will executed for all elements of arr
arr.forEach((val, i)=>{
    // here i is the index 
    console.log(`New Value = ${val+1} index = ${i}`);
});

Interview Question : What is HIGHER ORDER Functin?
=> forEach is Higher order functions or methods


------------MAP method--------
Map creats a new array with results of some operations. The value its callback returns are used to form new array
arr.map(callbackFun(value, index, array))
===== Main diff btw map and forEach is map returns a new array 


----------WINDOW Object----------------------------
The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is browsers object (not js) & is automatically created by browser
It is a global object with lots of properties & methods.
consol.log() here it is window.consol.log()
it is windows function.


=============== DOM ================
when a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.

In JS : we can access html code  using dom .
Window=> Document => html 

consol.log => is used to print 
console.dir => is used to print the object 

to make dynamic changes we use DOM  manipulation techniques.

DOM Manipulation :
selecting with id 
document.getElementById("myId")

selecting with class :
document.getElementByClassName("myClass")


selecting with tags :
document.getElementByTagName("p")

Query Selector
document.querySelector("muId/myClass/tag");
Returns first element

document.querySelectorAll("muId/myClass/tag");
//returns a node list 


Properties
1. tagName : returns tag for element nodes
2. innerText : returns the text content of the element and all its childern
3. innerHTML : returns the plain text or HTML contents in the element
4. textContent : returns textual content even for hidden elements  

Attributes 
1. getAttribute(attrName): Returns value of attribute if it exists , else null

let div = document.querySelector( "div" ); 
let attrId = div.getAttribute("id");
console.log(attrId); 

2. setAttribute(attr, value) : to set attribute value 
let para = document.querySelector("p");
console.log(para.setAttribute("class","new class"));

This changes the class name in elements in Inspect but not in actual html 


Style
node.sstyle 
let txt = document.querySelector("#PQ");
txt.style.color = "brown";
txt.style.fontSize = "50px";

INSERT Elements 
first Create element: 
let el = document.createElement("div");

node.append(el);
adds at the end of node (inside)

node.prepend(el); 
adds at the start of node (inside)

node.before(el);
Adds el before this Node(outside)

node.after(el);
Adds el after this Node(outside)

Delete Elements
node.remove()

---------------------- Events --------------- 
The changes in the state of an objest is known as an Event 
Events are fired to notify of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.

    * Mouse events (click, double click etc)
    * Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
    * Form events (submit, etc)
    * Print event & many more

Event Listeners


Events are actions that occur when something happens in the DOM. They can be attached using addEventListener method
Events are actions that occur when a user interacts with an HTML page. They can be triggered by mouse clicks, keyst
Events are actions that occur when something happens in a webpage like clicking on an image or button etc..

onclick is one such event which gets triggered when you click on an HTML element.

To add onclick to any element, simply write onclick="functionName" inside the tag.

Example : <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
          <script>
            function myFunction(){
              alert ("Button Clicked!");
            }
          </script>
          
There are many other events available like ondblclick for double clicking , onmousemove for moving mouse over an element and
There are many other events available like ondblclick for double clicking , onmouseover for mouse over and so on. You can find them
There are many other events available like onmouseover , onkeydown and so on. You can find them here : https://www.w
There are many other events available like onmouse

Prototype in JS: ----------------------------------------------

A javaScript object is an entity having state and behaviour (properties and methods).
JS object have a special property called prototype.
We can set prototype using __proto__

for eg :
const employee = {
    calTax(){
        console.log("Tax rate is 18%");
    }
};

const sam = {
    salary : 50000,
};

sam.__proto__ = employee; // adding the prototype of employee to sam

here i can access calTax form emp to sam using prototype, if there are many employees i dont have to write  this code for each employee. I just need to use sam.__proto__ = employee;


---------Super Keyword in JS-------
this super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parents properties and methods 

------------- Error Handling ------------

try-catch:

try{
    ..normal code
}
catch(err){
    ..handling error
}
 


-----------------------------------------Sync in JS==================

Synchronous : means the code runs in a particular sequence of instrction given in the program. 
Each instrction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

Asynchoronous : Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
Asynchoronous code execution allow to execute next instrctions immediately and doesnt block the flow.

setTimeout: 
it  will wait for the time specified in milliseconds then it will call the function passed as argument. 


================ Callbacks ===================
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
we pass callback without any partenthesis () 

---------------- Callback Hell -----------------
Nested callback stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid of Doom)

This sytle of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage. 

its kinda nested Callback
To solve this we use Promises. 

------------------ Promises ------------------------

YT  Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3jXofmQm44&list=PLGjplNEQ1it_oTvuLRNqXfz_v_0pq6unW&index=13&t=34m9s

Promises is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an option in JS. It is a soltion to callback Hell.

let promise = new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {....} )

resolve and reject are callback provided by JS.

it has 3 states 
1. Pending : the result is undefined
2. Resolve : the result is a value (fulfilled)
3. Reject : the result is an error object

Resolve and Recjet are 2 Handlers inbuilt by JS 

we have 2 functions then and catch 
promise.then( (res) => {....} )
here if the promise is resolved then promise.then is executed res is the value passed in resolve.

promise.catch( (err) =>{.....}) 
here of there is an error or it is rejected we can executre in {..} the error 
err is the value in  reject.

----------------- Async-Await -------------------
async function always returns a promise.


async function myFun(){...}

await pauses the execution of its surroundings async function until the promise is settled.

to use await need to call a function so instead we can use 

IIIFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expression

IIFE is a function that is called Immediately as soon as it is defined.

( function () {...})();

It can be only used once.


==================== FETCH API ==========================

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch

The fetch API provides an interface for fetching (sending/receiving) resources.
It uses Request and Response objects.
The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource (data).

let promise = fetch(url,[options])

AJAX is Asynchoronous JS & XML
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation 

json() method : returns a second promise that resolves with the results of parsing the response body text as JSON (Input is JSON, output is JS object).
